# QuartoReport

Example of a Quarto Report with dynamically created tables

Presentation given on this Aug 11 2022: [https://youtu.be/Uay6X65Ukvk](https://youtu.be/Uay6X65Ukvk). The version given in that talk is Release v2.0.

Short version (8 minutes) of collaboration with a Quarto report: [https://youtu.be/WvKw1OQIpMk](https://youtu.be/WvKw1OQIpMk)

## Try it out

[Try it in RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/content/4925654)

Or clone to your computer. To get the necessary packages, you can do
```
install.packages(renv) # if needed
renv::restore()
```
Or don't do that and click "Render" from the Build TAB. Then install the packages as it complains. **You will also need to install tinytex.** How? `install.packages(tinytex)` and then `install_tinytex()`.

## What is this doing?

* Dynamic tables and figures where the table number, table caption, number of tables is all dynamically created based on the data set
* Table cross-refs that just work across formats
* Figures that look good across formats and it "just works"---with the caveat that I am using {flextable} for Word/html and {kableExtra} for PDF.
* A custom title page for PDF.
* Link to source code, post issue, edit source code right on the HTML for each page.
* Link to download the PDF and Word. This is auto-generated. None of this is manual.
* HTML that looks good across different sized displays (big screen and phone screen)

## How about?

* {gt} is great. Why not use that for tables? It was not playing nice with Quarto+PDF and broke all table numbering in subsequent tables (flextable or kabelExtra or markdown). I reported the bug and I think the {gt} developers have fixed for the next update.

## Can't {bookdown} do this?

Kind of. I love {bookdown} and I have written multiple on-line books with it but 

* there were a lot of hacks and tricks needed for cross-refs and it would tend to break when you needed multiple formats (PDF, HTML and Word). 
* Lack of solid cross-ref working across formats is a deal-breaker for government reports.
* The ability to use "@" to find your cross-refs that you can do with Visual mode in RStudio... I can't live without that now. 
* Quarto still has some hacks, but many many fewer. A lot of stuff seems to just work.
